## 🚀 Quick Start

### Basic Usage

```python
from emissions_analyzer import EmissionsAnalyzer
from investment_analyzer import InvestmentAnalyzer

# Initialize analyzers
emissions = EmissionsAnalyzer()
investments = InvestmentAnalyzer()

# Load data
emissions_data = emissions.load_data("data/emissions.csv")
investment_data = investments.load_data("data/investments.csv")

# Perform analysis
correlation = emissions.correlate_with_investments(
    emissions_data, 
    investment_data
)

# Generate insights
insights = investments.generate_insights(correlation)
print(insights)
```

### Example Analysis

```python
# Analyze specific company or sector
company_analysis = analyzer.analyze_company("TSLA")
print(f"Emission Score: {company_analysis.emission_score}")
print(f"Investment Rating: {company_analysis.investment_rating}")
print(f"Green Score: {company_analysis.green_score}")

# Portfolio optimization
optimized_portfolio = analyzer.optimize_portfolio(
    portfolio_data,
    max_emissions=1000,  # tons CO2
    min_return=0.08      # 8% minimum return
)
```


## 📈 Use Cases
